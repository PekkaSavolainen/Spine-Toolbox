# cchardet used to be a dependency of datapackage and version 2.1.6 requires users to install Visual C++
# NOTE: Commented on purpose. datapackage 1.15.0 does not require cchardet anymore. If we ever decide to
# use cchardet in addition to chardet, we should remember this constraint.
# cchardet!=2.1.6
# matplotlib == 3.2.1 is broken; importing e.g. networkx after matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg backgtraces
# also, matplotlib == 3.2.1 requires shiboken2 but does not list it in its dependencies
# matplotlib 3.3.1 fails to install properly from pip, see

# We may want to remove matplotlib and numpy from requirements in the future and tell users to
# install them using the official installers.
matplotlib!=3.2.1, <3.3.1
# jsonschema is a requirement of datapackage (TODO: why do we only allow v2.6 here?)
jsonschema == 2.6
# pyrsistent is a requirement of tableschema which is a requirement of datapackage.
# tableschema 1.19.4 requires pyrsistent < 0.17
pyrsistent < 0.17
