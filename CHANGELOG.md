# Changelog
All **notable** changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Now it's possible to export graphs as PDF files from the *Graph* menu in the Data Store form.
- Now it's possible to prune entire classes from the graph view. The option is available both from the *Graph* menu and
  from *Entity Graph* context menus. Also, pruned items can be restored gradually.

### Changed
- The graph view behavior has changed. Now selecting objects in the object tree not only shows those objects but also 
  all the cascading relationships. This is to facilitate exploring the system without a previous knowledge.
- Moving object items in the graph view also causes relationship icons to follow. This behaviour can be disabled in the
  Settings form.

## [0.4.0.beta.0] - 2020-02-17

### Added
- A small notification icon is painted next to project items in the design view whenever they are missing some
  configuration. Hovering the icon shows tips for completing the configuration.
- A small icon is painted next to the project items in the design view to show the order in which they will be
  executed
- Main Window menu 'File -> Open recent'. Shortcut for opening a recent project.
- A new project item *Exporter* allows a database contained in a *Data Store* to be exported as GAMS `.gdx` file.
- It is now possible to copy and paste project items for example between projects.
- It is now possible to duplicate project items.
- Changes made in the tree view are also seen in the graph view and viceversa.
- New Setting: *Sticky selection in Graph View*. Enables users to select if they want to use multi-selection or 
  single selection in the Graph view Object tree when selecting items with the **left-mouse button**.
- Projects can be saved to any directory
- Project name can be changed in Settings
- The graph view features a short live demonstration that new users can follow to discover the basic functionality.
- New Setting: *Curved links*. When active, links on the Design View follow a smooth curve rather than a straight line.
- When execution traverses a link, a small animation is played to denote the flow of data. Users can set how quick
  they want this animation to be in Settings. The fastest setting effectively disables the animation.
- Special 'tag' command line arguments are now available in Tool Specification which expand to, for example,
  input database URLS or paths to optional input files when a Tool is executed.
- It is now possible to undo/redo database changes in the Data Store form.
- It is now possible to visualize the history of database changes in the Data Store form. The option is 
  available in the Session menu.
- Support for Tool command line arguments. You can now give Tool (project item) command 
  line arguments in addition to Tool Specification command line arguments.

### Changed
- spinetoolbox is now a Python package. To start the app, use command `python -m spinetoolbox` or
  `python spinetoolbox.py` as spinetoolbox.py has been moved to repository root. 
- Tool templates are now called Tool specifications
- File->Open Project opens a file dialog, where you can open projects by selecting an old 
  <project_name>.proj file or a Spine Toolbox Project directory. Valid Spine Toolbox projects are 
  decorated with the Spine logo.
- When opening an old style project (.proj file), the project must be upgraded to a new style project 
  by selecting a new directory for the project.
- Project information is not saved to a <project_name>.proj file anymore. This information is now located 
  in file <project_dir>/.spinetoolbox/project.json. Every Spine Toolbox project has this file.
- Work directory is now a global setting instead of a project setting
- Renamed *Data Interface* project item to *Importer*.
  The corresponding category *Data Importers* was renamed to *Importers*.
- The status bar of the Data store view is gone. Instead, notifications are printed in a box on the right side of
  the form.
- Tree, graph, and tabular views have been merged into one consolidated view. You can choose your preferred style
  from the View menu.

### Deprecated
- Saving project information to .proj files

### Removed

### Fixed
- Data advertised by a project item during execution is only accessible by its direct children.
  In other words, resources are passed to the next items in line but not beyond.
- Executing the Importer project item has been fixed on Windows release version

### Security

## [0.3] - 2019-09-06

### Added

  items by pressing the Ctrl-key down and dragging the mouse.
- New project item icons on Design View.
- Two options for the Design View background (grid or solid). See Settings (F1).
- Python Console (menu View -> Dock Widgets -> Python Console).
- Python interpreter can be selected in Settings (Also Python 2.7 supported).
- Support for Python Tool templates
- Python Tool execution using the command line approach.

  selecting one or more project items belonging to the wanted DAG in the Design View or in Project Items list.
- Stop button to main window Toolbar, which terminates execution.
- Possibility to specify a dedicated Julia project or environment for Spine Toolbox in the settings.
- Feature to Export project to GraphML format. Each graph in Design View is written to its own file. To do this, just
  select *Export project to GraphML* from the Project Item list context-menu or from *File ->
  Export project to GraphML*.
- New project item: *Data Interface*
- Parameter and relationship parameter values can now be edited in a dedicated editor window in Tree, Graph and Tabular
  views. The editor is accessible by right-clicking a value and selecting `Open in editor...`.
- It is now possible to plot parameter and relationship parameter values in Tree, Graph and Tabular views.

### Fixed
- There is now an upper limit on how much text is logged in Event Log and Process Log. The oldest lines are removed
  if the limit is exceeded. This fixes a problem with excessive memory usage when running long processes.
- Mouse click problems in Design View
- Mouse cursor problem in Tool Configuration Assistant
- Welcome message is now shown for first time users
- NameError: SpineDBAPIError when executing Data Stores.
- .py files in *spinedb_api\alembic\versions* are now copied to the installation bundle without compiling them to
  .pyc files first. Also, if there's a previous version installed, *spinedb_api\alembic* directory is deleted
  before installation begins [Win-x64].
- Added missing modules from *spinedb_api\alembic\versions* package into installation bundle [Win-x64].
- *numpy* is now deleted before installation begins so installing over an existing installation of Spine Toolbox
  works again [Win-x64].
- *packaging* and *appdirs* packages are now included in the installation bundle [Win-x64].

### Changed
- Selecting the Julia environment in Settings now requires picking the Julia interpreter **file**
  (e.g. julia.exe on Windows) instead of the directory where the Julia interpreter is located.
- Selecting the GAMS program (**file**) in Settings now requires picking the GAMS program (e.g. gams.exe
  on Windows) instead of the directory where the GAMS program is located.
- All application Settings are now saved using Qt's QSettings class. Old configuration file,
  *conf/settings.conf* file has been removed.
- New Spine databases can be created in any backend supported by spinedb_api. The Data Store item properties
  have been changed to allow for this.
- Executing Directed Acyclic Graphs instead of just Tools.
- Executing project items does not happen from the Tool Properties anymore. It happens instead by pressing the
  Play button in the main window Toolbar.

### Removed
- An unnecessary error dialog in Import Preview widget.
- ConfigurationParser class in configuration.py.
- Execute button in Tool Properties.
- Stop button in Tool Properties.
- Console window that opened in addition to the application window is not shown anymore [Win-x64].

  from all data store items connected to it.
- Packages numpy, scipy, and matplotlib are now mandatory requirements.
- Drag files between data connections. File items can be dragged from the references and data lists.
  Data connection items can be selected by hovering them while dragging a file. Dropping files onto a Data Connection
  item copies them to its data directory.
